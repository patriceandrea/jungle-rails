- **Sold Out Badge**: If a product has 0 quantity, a sold out badge is displayed. 
- **Admin Categories**: Restful routes was created into the app where the admin can create a new category. 
- **User Authentication**: User can sign up and login from any page of the app. 
- **Order Details Page**: An Order confirmation page is created to display content of the product including the final amount of the order.
